    "Extract cross-sale patterns from historical data to learn what drives clients to purchase specific products.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "1. **Cross-Sale Pattern Learning**: Use only cross-sale clients to learn product-specific patterns\n",
    "2. **Multi-Product Targets**: Create separate targets for each product category\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Features**: Include life stage triggers, market context, and interaction features\n",
    "4. **Current Market Application**: Apply learned patterns to current clients with current market conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Strategy\n",
    "- Use same client_metrics extraction approach as original model\n",
    "- Filter by business_month for active clients\n",
    "- Focus on cross-sale clients for pattern learning\n",
    "- Include market conditions at decision point\n"

    "### This notebook creates:\n",
    "1. **Robust 3-Tier Product Classification**: Business Line → Sub-Category → Characteristics\n",
    "2. **6 Primary Target Variables**: Life, Retirement, Investment, Network, Disability, Health\n",
    "3. **10 Sub-Category Targets**: Granular retirement and life insurance types\n",
    "4. **Enhanced Features**: Life stage triggers, risk tolerance, interaction features\n",
    "5. **Market Context**: S&P 500 data at decision point (3 months before cross-sell)\n",
    "6. **Product Metadata**: Tax treatment, investment type, account type for explainability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three-Tier Architecture:\n",
    "- **Tier 1 (Primary Models)**: 6 business-aligned categories for main predictions\n",
    "- **Tier 2 (Sub-Categories)**: 10 granular product types for detailed recommendations\n",
    "- **Tier 3 (Characteristics)**: Tax treatment, investment type for agent insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next notebook will:\n",
    "1. **Add temporal features**: Volatility, momentum, trend indicators\n",
    "2. **Create market interaction features**: Market × Client, Market × Risk combinations\n",
    "3. **Prepare for training**: Feature selection and preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Innovations:\n",
    "- **Robust Classification**: Multi-field validation ensures accurate product categorization\n",
    "- **Business Aligned**: Uses prod_lob as primary with fallback logic\n",
    "- **Scalable**: New products automatically fit into existing hierarchy\n",
    "- **Explainable**: Rich metadata for agent conversations\n",
    "- **Decision Point Analysis**: Market conditions at actual decision time (3 months before cross-sell)\n"

    "## Validation Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to verify:\n",
    "1. **Product categories have data** - All 6 primary targets should have counts greater than 0\n",
    "2. **No null classifications** - cross_sell_product_category should not be null\n",
    "3. **Sub-categories align** - Retirement sub-categories only appear when retirement_cross_sell equals 1\n",
    "4. **Market data joined** - All records should have S&P 500 data\n",
    "5. **Cross-sell patterns make sense** - Check the transition matrix above\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ready for Notebook 02:\n",
    "If validations pass, proceed to enhanced feature engineering in the next notebook.\n"
