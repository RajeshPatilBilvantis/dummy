    "# Multi-Product Cross-Sell Model - Enhanced Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Add interaction features and market context indicators to improve model performance and explainability for agent recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "1. **Product Affinity Patterns**: FROM → TO product transition features\n",
    "2. **Market Context Indicators**: S&P 500 volatility, trends, momentum using actual data\n",
    "3. **Interaction Features**: Age × Product, AUM × Product, Channel × Product, Market × Product\n",
    "4. **Cross-Sell Timing Features**: Quick vs delayed cross-sell patterns\n",
    "5. **Explainability Features**: Rich metadata for agent conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "- Build on multi_product_training_data from notebook 01 (already has market data and life stage triggers)\n",
    "- Add product transition affinity features\n",
    "- Create market context indicators using actual S&P fields\n",
    "- Generate interaction features for better predictions\n",
    "- Prepare final feature set for multi-output model training\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "Notebook 01 already provides: client features, life stage triggers, risk tolerance, asset allocation, and S&P 500 data.\n",
    "This notebook adds the final layer of interaction and affinity features.\n"

    "### This notebook creates:\n",
    "1. **Market Context Indicators**: S&P 500 volatility, trends, momentum using actual fields\n",
    "2. **Product Affinity Patterns**: FROM → TO transition features (6 patterns)\n",
    "3. **Age × Product Interactions**: Senior, mid-career, young client targeting (8 features)\n",
    "4. **AUM × Product Interactions**: High, medium AUM targeting (5 features)\n",
    "5. **Channel × Product Interactions**: Branch, advisor channel affinity (4 features)\n",
    "6. **Market × Product Affinity**: Volatile/stable market product demand (4 features)\n",
    "7. **Risk Tolerance × Product**: Aggressive/conservative investor targeting (4 features)\n",
    "8. **Life Stage × Product**: Trigger-based product affinity (6 features)\n",
    "9. **Cross-Sell Timing Features**: Quick, medium, delayed patterns (6 features)\n",
    "10. **Ideal Candidate Features**: Combined affinity for explainability (4 features)\n",

    "- **Uses actual S&P fields**: No simulated data, only real market indicators\n",
    "- **Product affinity patterns**: Learns FROM → TO transitions\n",
    "- **Explainability ready**: Ideal candidate features for agent conversations\n",
    "- **Business aligned**: Features match how agents think about clients\n",
    "- **Timing aware**: Cross-sell speed patterns for urgency scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Notebook 03**: Train multi-output XGBoost models using this final dataset\n",
    "- **Focus on 4 main categories**: Life, Retirement, Investment, Network (Health/Disability optional)\n",
    "- **Use AutoML or custom training**: Both approaches supported\n",
    "- **Feature importance**: Will show which interaction features matter most\n",
