In a new cell, i want to compare and see if any clients who has a single product in the last month, took a second product 
this month-if so, which product.
so, take the axa_party_id of clients in max_business_month from eda_smartlist.us_wealth_management_smartlist.ML_predictions_95_single_policy table. 
search if these clients bought a second product. if, so, we need to write to the table 
'eda_smartlist.us_wealth_management_smartlist.ML_predictions_comparision'. 
it should have axa_party_id, first_product_category, predicted_product (from ML_predictions_95_single_policy table), actual_product_bought
