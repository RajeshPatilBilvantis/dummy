Current Situation
The model is trained only once.
The trained model is saved as an artifact.
The same model is reused for every monthly pipeline run.
No retraining happens in subsequent months.
Problem
The model does not learn from new data.
There is no feedback loop to decide when retraining is required.
Over time, this can lead to model drift and degraded performance.
Requirement
Introduce a feedback loop in the pipeline.
The feedback loop should automatically decide when to retrain the model.
Retraining should be event-driven, not blindly done every month.
One Proposed Approach (Example)
Create a table to store clients who have ≥ 2 products at the time of model training.
This table acts as a baseline snapshot.
Monthly Pipeline Logic
During every monthly pipeline run:
Identify clients with ≥ 2 products in the current month.
Exclude clients already present in the baseline table.
Count the new clients who now meet this condition.
Retraining Trigger Condition
Compare the number of new qualifying clients with a predefined threshold.
If the increase exceeds the threshold:
Trigger the model retraining pipeline.
If not:
Continue using the existing trained model.
Outcome
Model retraining happens only when there is meaningful data change.
Prevents unnecessary retraining.
Ensures the model stays relevant and up to date.
