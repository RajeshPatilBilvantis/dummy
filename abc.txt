take a business_month, say, 202509.
take all the axa_party_id who has a single policy (policy_no is an indicator of a policy and axa_party_id is the unique client identifier).
compare these axa_party_id with the same ones in business_month 202510 and filter the axa_party_id from 202510 who has more than 1 policy when compared.
then, we take these axa_party_id and pass them through our model for validation. if the prediction and the above compared clients' second policy is same, we can say that our model is performing well.
