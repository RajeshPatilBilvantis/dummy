Monthly Tracking & Feedback Loop

From February onwards, every monthly run should include:

Current month predictions for clients with one product

Previous month’s predicted clients:

Whether they actually purchased the predicted second policy or not

This comparison must be shared as part of every monthly pipeline output.

i also want global perspctive of shap.
so,take the eda_smartlist.us_wealth_management_smartlist.ML_predictions_single_policy table (this has model predictions and more). 
divide the clients(axa_party_id) into 2 buckets - one for clients who has pred_prob>=0.90 and one for clients who has pred_prob<=0.80. 
asses and compare the reasons (features) for them to get a particular predicted_product.
