I'll analyze each plot to provide actionable insights for your cross-selling ML model:

1. Target Distribution
Key Insights:

Annuities (~40,000 clients) is the dominant next product purchased

Life Insurance and Investment Products are also major cross-sell opportunities (~30,000 and ~15,000 respectively)

Specialty Insurance and Major Medical Insurance show extremely low counts (~500-1,000 clients)

ML Implications:

Class imbalance problem: Consider combining rare categories or using sampling techniques

Focus model optimization on the top 3 categories for maximum business impact

May need separate models for rare categories or exclude them from multi-class prediction

2. Client Age Band Distribution
Key Insights:

Bimodal distribution: Peak at 35-52 years (~28,000 clients) and 65-79 years (~25,000 clients)

Represents two distinct life stages: working professionals and pre-retirees

Fewer clients in middle age (53-64) and very elderly (80+) segments

Cross-Selling Strategy:

Different product strategies needed for each age cohort

Age will be a highly predictive feature in your ML model

3. Client Segment Distribution
Key Insights:

Middle to upper-middle class dominance: 400-999k (~18,000) and 1-2.99m (~15,000) segments

Significant lower-income segment (<200k ~12,000 clients)

Ultra-high-net-worth clients (5m+) represent smallest segment (~2,000 clients)

Business Opportunity:

Largest revenue potential in the 400k-3m segment

Specialized strategies needed for <200k (affordability-focused) and 5m+ (premium services)

4. AUM Band Distribution
Key Insights:

Heavy concentration in lower AUM bands: <$25K (~65,000 clients) dominates

Progressive decline in client counts as AUM increases

Only ~5,000 clients in the >$500K category

Critical Finding:

Potential data quality issue: Most clients showing very low AUM despite being in higher income segments

Verify if AUM represents only company assets vs. total client wealth

5. Client Tenure Distribution
Key Insights:

Right-skewed distribution with peak at 5-8 years tenure

Growing customer base: Many recent acquisitions (0-15 years)

Loyal client base: Long tail extending to 80+ years showing excellent retention

Cross-Selling Timing:

Prime cross-selling window appears to be 5-15 years (established relationship, not yet saturated)

6. AUM vs Next Product Purchased
Key Insights:

Wealth-based product preferences clearly visible:

Annuities: Highest median AUM (~$400K), appeals to wealthy clients

Investment Products: Second highest AUM, premium client focus

Life Insurance: Wide AUM range, universal appeal

Disability Income: Lower AUM focus, protection-oriented

ML Feature Engineering:

AUM will be a strong predictor for product recommendation

Consider AUM percentiles rather than absolute values for better model generalization

7. Client Age vs Next Product Purchased
Key Insights:

Clear age-based product lifecycle:

Younger clients (40-60): Life Insurance, Disability Income (protection focus)

Middle-aged (55-70): Annuities, Investment Products (wealth accumulation)

Older clients (65+): Equitable Network (wealth preservation)

Strategy Implication:

Age-based segmentation will be crucial for model accuracy

Product recommendations should follow natural life-stage progression

9. Product Ownership Indicators
Key Insights:

Annuities lead in current ownership (~50,000 policies)

Life Insurance and Investment Products show strong existing penetration

Major Medical and Specialty Insurance have minimal market penetration

Cross-Selling Opportunity:

High ownership categories suggest successful products that could be expanded

Low-penetration categories (Medical, Specialty) represent untapped markets

10. Agent Rank vs Next Product Purchased
Key Insights:

Branch Managers drive the most cross-selling activity across all products

Regular Agents show balanced cross-selling across major products

District Managers focus more on high-value products (Annuities, Investment Products)

Agent Strategy:

Agent rank will be a valuable feature - different ranks have different cross-selling patterns

Training and incentives should be tailored by agent level

11. Client Segment vs Next Product Purchased
Key Insights:

Wealth-aligned product preferences:

High-net-worth (3-5m+): Primarily Annuities and Investment Products

Middle market (400k-3m): Balanced across all major products

Lower segments (<400k): Focus on Life Insurance and Disability Income

Targeting Strategy:

Clear wealth-based product alignment enables precise targeting

Each segment has distinct cross-selling opportunities

12. AUM Band vs Next Product Purchased
Key Insights:

>$500K AUM clients: Strong preference for Investment Products and Annuities

<$100K AUM clients: Predominantly choose Life Insurance

Middle AUM bands: More balanced product mix

Model Training:

AUM bands show strong predictive power for product preference

Consider creating AUM-specific models or features

13. Client Tenure vs Next Product Purchased
Key Insights:

Newer clients (0-15 years): Higher likelihood of Life Insurance cross-sell

Established clients (15-30 years): Favor Investment Products and Equitable Network

Long-term clients (30+ years): Gravitate toward premium products

Strategic ML Model Recommendations
High-Impact Features:
AUM/Client Segment (strongest wealth indicator)

Client Age (clear lifecycle patterns)

Current Product Portfolio (cross-selling patterns)

Agent Rank (sales capability indicator)

Client Tenure (relationship maturity)
