Solution 1: Cross-Sell Propensity Model (Yes/No Classification)
Objective

Predict whether an existing customer (who has only one current product/plan) is likely to purchase another product.

Type of Problem

Binary Classification → Output is Yes/No.

Steps Involved

Data Extraction (from Hadoop / Hue)

Data resides in Hive tables inside Hadoop.

Use PySpark / Hive queries in Python to fetch relevant data.

Example: Customer demographics, policy details, transactions, claims history.

Why? → Data must be centralized before preprocessing and model training.

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values (e.g., impute with mean/median or “Unknown”).

Encode categorical variables (OneHotEncoding/LabelEncoding).

Normalize or scale numerical features if needed.

Remove outliers or inconsistent values.

Why? → Clean, consistent data improves model performance and reduces bias.

Feature Engineering

Customer age groups (e.g., <30, 30-50, >50).

Policy tenure buckets.

Claim frequency.

Interaction frequency (e.g., website logins, agent meetings).

Why? → Derived features capture patterns that raw data might miss.

Train-Test Split

Divide dataset into train (70–80%) and test (20–30%).

Why? → To evaluate generalization and avoid overfitting.

Model Selection & Training

Start with simple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.

Move to advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.

Why? → Logistic gives interpretability, while ensemble models improve accuracy.

Model Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Why? → Cross-sell use cases need recall (don’t miss a potential buyer) and precision (don’t annoy customers with wrong offers).

Deployment & Monitoring

Expose as REST API (FastAPI/Flask) for real-time scoring.

Monitor drift and retrain periodically.

Why? → Business environment and customer behavior changes over time.

Solution 2: Next Best Product Recommendation (Multi-Class / Ranking Problem)
Objective

For customers with only one current product, predict which product they are most likely to buy next.

Type of Problem

Multi-Class Classification → Predict a product class (e.g., Health, Life, Vehicle).

OR Ranking / Recommendation → Rank top-N products for each customer.

Steps Involved

Data Extraction (Hadoop / Hue)

Pull transaction + policy + product history from Hive tables.

Why? → Recommendation requires past purchase patterns.

Data Preprocessing

Similar steps as Solution 1 (missing values, encoding, scaling).

Map customers to historical purchases and sequence of products.

Why? → Sequence/order matters in recommendations (e.g., Life → Health → Vehicle).

Feature Engineering

Customer Profile Features: Age, income, family size.

Behavioral Features: Previous claims, frequency of renewals.

Product Affinity Features: Which products are often purchased together.

Why? → Captures both customer behavior and product relationships.

Problem Framing

Option A (Classification): Each product type is a class → predict which one.

Option B (Recommendation System): Use Collaborative Filtering / Matrix Factorization / Neural Recommenders.

Why? → Classification is simple, Recommendation is more powerful but complex.

Model Training

Start with multi-class classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost).

Try Recommendation models:

Collaborative Filtering (ALS in Spark MLlib).

Neural Recommenders (e.g., DeepFM, LightFM).

Why? → Product purchase is not purely independent → CF learns latent patterns.

Model Evaluation

Classification Metrics: Accuracy, Top-3 Recall.

Recommendation Metrics: Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG.

Why? → Business cares if the correct product appears in Top-3 recommendations.

Deployment & Monitoring

Provide Top-N product recommendations via API.

Track conversion rate uplift (business KPI).

Why? → Continuous improvement is required for personalization.

Why Solution 1 vs Solution 2?

Solution 1 (Cross-Sell Yes/No):

Easier, faster to implement.

Useful when business just wants to know who is likely to buy, not what to sell.

Solution 2 (Next Best Product):

More advanced & personalized.

Helps business target with the right product → higher conversion.

But needs more data & modeling complexity.
