print("1. A substantial number of clients buy multiple products, validating the problem.")
print("2. There are strong, predictable patterns linking the first product a client buys to their second.")
print("3. Client characteristics like financial segment and age are correlated with their product choices.")
print("\nTherefore, we have high confidence that creating a training dataset that combines a client's profile with their first product details will provide the necessary signals to build an effective 'next best product' model.")
